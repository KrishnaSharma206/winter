# Object Recognition Warehouse Robot

## Summary

A robot that recohnizes certain shapes and navigates it's way accordingly, I am going to build this robot because I liked the idea of the amazon warehouse
robot and the projects made by a guy named James Bruton, and I really wanna learn about object recognition through this project. I already have some
experience making robots using arduino, so it will be something new for me.

## Plan

I will be using the jetson nano as the brain of this project, the raspberry pi wont be very pwerful for this and the jetson nano will be a better alternative
, I will be using a camera for the detection and I am planning to add more sensors and actuators to it in the future.
1. I will be using my laptop with the jetson nano using a vnc
2. I will first train the ai model on the jetson nano using basic shapes for easier recognition
3. I will build the robot, then program the robot using python
4. I will then finally test it.

## Budget

| Rover5 expansion plate | https://www.pololu.com/product/1530                         | $21.95  |
| Total                  |                                                             | $265.95    |

Note: I will buy buy the rest of the parts by myself, the parts I have mentioned above are the ones that I could not get in my country and aretoo expensive
for me to buy.
